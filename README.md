# GraphTraverse
When executing the application please remember that you must pass
the path of the graph file as a command line argument. Additionally run the application using intellij, 
this is what i used for development and testing and did not have any issues getting terminal input from it, however i did using commandline sbt on windows. don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions
